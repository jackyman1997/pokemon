## things to investigate 
- how to determine player 1  
it is predetermined by the battle log from <a href='https://pokemonshowdown.com/'>pokemonshowdown</a>.  
However, player 1 can be thought of who so ever move first in the log, rather than just the systematic assigning. 

- if using accuracy (TP/PP) as a performance indicator, the dataset needs to be balanced (ie, prevalance = 50%)

- what is the role of RNG within the battle  
they are the noise and without them the model is boring because it will be doing to good

- cost of FN or FP (quantising the consequences of mis-classifying)  
although there are no consequences of losing, emotional inpact can be a way to quantise the cost  
google Daniel Khanimen??? (idea: 1 losing needs 2 winnings to compensate the emotion)
